Running main.py:
- Change variable "usingReut" to determine if Reuters or BNC Corpus is used
- At the bottom of the file, comment and uncomment the parts you do and don't want to run/print

When running first time, stopworded.pkl or stopwordedReut.pkl will be generated. Subsequent runs will utilize these saved files and save processing time.
